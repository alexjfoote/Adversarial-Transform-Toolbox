# Usage

To use these tutorials you need to download the contents of this folder and save them in your desired location. The easiest option is to clone this repo - to a google drive directory and use Google Colab to run the notebooks. Colab has all the dependencies of the toolbox installed and has free GPUs available, making it an easy way to get started quickly. 

You can also clone the repo locally, create a virtual environment within the directory, and `pip install reetoolbox` to use the toolbox on a local machine.
